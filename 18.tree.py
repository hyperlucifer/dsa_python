tree is a non-linear data structure
tree is define as a finite set of a one or more data items/nodes such that there is a 
special node called the root node of the tree and the remaining nodes are the partationed 
into n>=0 disjoin subsets each of which is itself a tree and they are know as subtree..

degree of the tree 
the degree is a number of edges comming out from a node is a degree of a node,,,
the node with the higest degree is a degree of a tree
the node with the zero degree is called a leaf node 

level number
the level of a tree is the number of nodes above a specific node along it;s path towords the 
root node starting from zero 
but, generation starts from 1 

eg root has the level of zero,and exeat next node from the root has 1 level

tree only grows downwords 
we can ony access the nodes that are downwords of a specific node

when ending is on the leaf node that is called branch

height of a tree 
= level +1

sibings
the nodes with the common parents

a tree with >=2 degree for all the nodes is called binary tree
